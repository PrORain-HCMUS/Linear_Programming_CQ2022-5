# Linear_Programming_CQ2022-5

This is where i upload all my works, resources and related documents for the subject of Linear Programming. The subject requires basic knowledge of Python programming, Linear Algebra, and includes: 4 Homeworks, 2 In-class tests, 1 Midterm Test, 1 EndTerm Test and 1 Seminar.

More specifically:
1. MidTerm: The students have 1 week to solve [this problem set](MidTerm/de GK mon QHTT 2025.pdf)
2. EndTerm: The problem set was once posted [here](https://www.facebook.com/groups/194100121222992) but unfortunately it has been removed due to an error. Anyway, this problem set includes 40 questions vary in 2 types: Multiple-choice questions and to-be-filled-in questions. There are 2 former problem sets for EndTerm test which you can take as references. 
3. Seminar: Students work in groups of up-to-5 people, and choose their own topics to prepare a seminar, which consists of slides and video (documents are not required). In particular, mine was [*Aplication of Linear Programming in Markov Decision Process*](Seminar/Slide.pdf). You can find our video [here](https://youtu.be/1ybFCWxHqcI).
